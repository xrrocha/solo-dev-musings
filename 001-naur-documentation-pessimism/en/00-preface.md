This paper articulates a refined understanding of Peter Naur's "Programming as Theory Building" (1985), arguing that his famous pessimism about documentation is narrower than commonly supposed—and that human-AI collaboration creates conditions for theory transmission that Naur could not have anticipated.

## A Note on Authorship

This document was written in collaboration between a human (Ricardo) and an AI (Claude). We reveal this not as decoration but because it matters: Naur's philosophy, formulated forty years ago, offers unexpectedly precise guidance for this new form of collaboration.

If programming is theory building, and theory lives in minds, the question for our era is: can an AI participate in that construction? Our experience suggests yes—but with protocols that account for a fundamental asymmetry: the human remembers; the AI forgets. From that asymmetry emerges a practice.

## The Strawman Caveat

Before proceeding, an act of intellectual honesty.

The original thesis for this paper was: *AI collaboration makes theory preservation possible because it reduces the labor costs that made comprehensive documentation impractical.*

This is wrong. It misreads Naur's argument. His pessimism is **epistemological**, not economic. He claims certain knowledge *cannot in principle* be articulated—not that we lack time to articulate it.

We include this caveat explicitly because others will arrive with the same intuition. The strawman is attractive. Rejecting it sharpens what AI collaboration actually changes—and what it doesn't.
