# On Naur's Documentation Pessimism

> ![TL;DR](/img/tl-dr.webp) **Naur's pessimism is narrower than supposed.** It applies to technical documentation of artifacts, not documentation as a human endeavor. AI doesn't "solve" the problem—but it creates conditions where theory transmission becomes more likely.

![On Naur's Documentation Pessimism](../img/00-hero.webp)

Peter Naur argued that programming is theory building, and that theory cannot be captured in documentation. But his pessimism targets *technical* documentation—specs, code, design docs—not all written communication. The Renaissance proves documents *can* transmit theory when written to do so.

AI collaboration doesn't solve the documentation problem by reducing labor (that misreads Naur's epistemological argument). But it creates novel conditions: forced articulation, preserved dialogue, lower-friction iteration. These make theory transmission more likely, even if never complete.

This document was written by a human and an AI working together. We reveal this because Naur's philosophy, formulated in 1985, offers unexpectedly precise guidance for human-AI collaboration.
