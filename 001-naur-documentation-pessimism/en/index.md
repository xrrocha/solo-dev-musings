# On Naur's Documentation Pessimism

> ![TL;DR](../../img/tl-dr.webp) In 1985, Peter Naur argued that programming is theory-building, and that theory cannot be fully captured in documentation. **But his pessimism is narrower than supposed.** It applies to technical documentation of artifacts, not documentation as a human endeavor. AI doesn't "solve" the problem—but it creates conditions where theory transmission becomes more likely.

![On Naur's Documentation Pessimism](../img/00-hero.webp)

In 1985, computer scientist [Peter Naur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Naur) published "Programming as Theory Building"—a short, influential essay arguing that programming is fundamentally about building mental models, not producing code. The programmer's *theory* of how real-world problems map to software is the essential product; code and documentation are secondary artifacts. Crucially, Naur claimed this theory **cannot be fully captured in documentation**, because it involves tacit knowledge that defies formalization. (See [our summary](naur-paper-en.md) or the [original paper](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdf).)

But Naur's pessimism targets *technical* documentation—specs, code, design docs—not all written communication. The Renaissance proves documents *can* transmit theory when written to do so.

AI collaboration doesn't solve the documentation problem by reducing labor (that misreads Naur's epistemological argument). But it creates novel conditions: forced articulation, preserved dialogue, lower-friction iteration. These make theory transmission more likely, even if never complete.
