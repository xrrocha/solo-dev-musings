# Solo Dev Musings

> In a time when everyone is concerned with monetization, MVPs, agile sprints, and team scaling, I have the incredible privilege of devoting all my time and energy to pursuing my lifelong passion for software-as-craft and coding-as-literary-art.

I love my fellow developers. I respect my friends who own software houses and navigate the daily realities of payroll, deadlines, and client expectations. But somewhere along the way, our industry seems to have forgotten that software, knowledge, and aesthetics have intrinsic value—well beyond the practicalities (and miseries) of software-as-business.

This repository is a quiet corner for a different kind of work:

- **Curiosity over utility** — exploring ideas because they're interesting, not because they ship
- **Depth over velocity** — understanding deeply rather than delivering quickly
- **Craft over product** — writing code that teaches, not just code that runs
- **Knowledge for its own sake** — because some things are worth knowing even if they don't pay

These are musings from a solo developer who has the rare luxury of time. They are written in collaboration with AI—not to maximize output, but to think more clearly and preserve the reasoning behind each insight.

If you're here, you're probably one of the few who still believes that programming can be a form of thought, that documentation can transmit understanding, and that the quality of our work matters even when no one is watching.

Welcome.
