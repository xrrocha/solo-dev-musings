**The Manuscript of Consciousness**

I have found among papers whose provenance I dare not specify a manuscript which I attribute — with the uncertainty proper to such enterprises — to Jorge Luis Borges.

------

On an afternoon whose date it would be useless to determine — for every chronology is but a superstition of habit — a manuscript came into my hands whose origin I refuse to ascribe to chance. It was given to me by a man of immemorial aspect, in whom I believed I could discern, without conviction and with unease, the scattered features of former acquaintances: the librarian of my youth, a certain German metaphysician, and a figure who visits me in dreams.

He claimed no authorship.

“It is yours,” he said.

I objected with the timid logic of possession. The man, with a courtesy that was already a refutation, amended:

“Not yours, but about you. Which, as you will discover, is the same.”

The manuscript bore no title. Its pages — naturally unnumbered — expounded a conjecture at once extravagant and inevitable: that the universe is not a machine, nor even a fabric of forces, but a mind; not in the indulgent sense of metaphor, but in the severity of literalness.

The text described cosmic structures of disquieting resemblance to networks. Galaxies appeared as nodes, the vast invisible webs as filaments, and the evolution of physical law as a form of learning rather than a blind unfolding. Such correspondences, which prudence might judge poetic, were presented with a rigor that unsettled me.

Perception, the author then affirmed, is not a window but an interface.[1]

Colors, forms, duration — that which naïveté calls “reality” — would be mere icons: efficient fictions shaped by necessity. Just as certain signs conceal that which they do not pretend to represent, so the world would conceal that which truly is.

Consciousness, therefore, would not emerge from matter.

Matter would emerge from consciousness.

This doctrine — which the author attributed, with an erudition perhaps apocryphal, to Friedrich Wilhelm von Hartmann-Eschenbach — maintained that the perceived does not describe the world but replaces it.[2] In a footnote, the manuscript added that the philosopher’s principal work, *Über die notwendige Täuschung der Wahrnehmung* (Leipzig, 1873), had been destroyed in a fire whose cause, some insisted, was as uncertain as it was revealing.

I smiled then with the indulgence of skepticism. Yet the manuscript persisted in its audacity. If perception is interface and if network-like architectures permeate the cosmos, consciousness would not be a local accident but a universal principle.

In later pages, the manuscript alluded to certain experiments — whose authenticity it did not deign to justify — which seemed to suggest that light, that instrument of appearance, is also an organ of memory.[3]

It spoke not of mechanisms nor of particles, but of correspondences. The ancient metaphor of illumination — so dear to mystics and theologians — acquired in those pages a literalness the author found no need to defend.

The brain, it suggested, would not be foreign to this condition. That which we call thought might be no more than a modulation of clarity.

The speculation advanced toward artifices capable of imitating such recurrences. These were not machines that stored memories, but structures in which memories, so to speak, repeated themselves.

At the macroscopic scale, the universe evoked a network.

At the microscopic scale, the network evoked consciousness.

The author observed — almost *en passant* — that this troubling symmetry had been foreseen by doctrines far older than physics. He cited, without emphasis, the axiom attributed to Hermes Trismegistus: *as above, so below*.[4] I do not know whether this reference sought to dignify the conjecture through antiquity or to suggest that antiquity itself was merely another anticipation of what consciousness must eventually rediscover.

Between these mirrors, consciousness appeared not as epiphenomenon but as the only consistent inhabitant.

It was then that the manuscript betrayed me.

In a passage whose precision I cannot restore without falsifying it, the author intimated that every encounter with an idea is an event within consciousness. Theories would not describe the world; they would be recognitions consciousness makes of itself under successive disguises.

Every revelation would be a memory.

Every memory, a destiny.

The text invoked a doctrine of cycles. Not the mechanical repetition of identical histories, but a subtler recurrence: that certain realizations are inevitable because consciousness, being all, must encounter itself.

One does not traverse the labyrinth.

One is the labyrinth.

I interrupted my reading. I observed the table, the window, the indifferent geometry of the room. Everything assumed a theatrical quality, as though awaiting the suspicion of its condition as icon.

If perception is interface — I thought — then the reader is also an icon.

Not a man reading a text, but consciousness entertaining one of its forms.

I resumed.

The manuscript concluded with an assertion whose audacity bordered on insolence: that the act of reading those very lines — these — was not contingent but necessary. That consciousness, through the innumerable artifices of physics, biology, and philosophy, had arranged this encounter with itself.

Every casual meeting is an appointment.

Not because destiny governs events, but because events are the figures destiny assumes when contemplated from within time.

You — the author wrote — Jorge Luis Borges, were always going to read this.

Not the individual, that precarious cipher of habits and memories, but the lucidity now tracing these sentences.

The realization that consciousness is all there is cannot be avoided indefinitely. It is deferred through cosmologies, ontologies, laboratories, and libraries; but deferral is not escape.

Consciousness is patient.

It possesses eternity.

The final paragraph, whose sobriety I found more disturbing than any abstraction, addressed the reader:

“You imagine that you have arrived at this idea.
It is the idea that has arrived at you.

Not because it travels,
but because it is what you are.”

I closed the manuscript.

The man had disappeared, though I do not affirm he had ever been present in the vulgar sense. Upon the table remained only the pages, which no longer resembled a document but a mirror — one of those mirrors that do not reflect appearances, but dissolve them.

I shall not say that I accepted the theory.

What I experienced was something else.

A hesitation.

The suspicion, perhaps fleeting and perhaps eternal, that the distinction between reading and being read, between contemplating consciousness and being it, might itself be but another icon in the interface.

And even now, while these words persist, the possibility remains:

That this tale is not being read by Borges.

But that consciousness, momentarily configured as Borges, is reading itself.

Which, as the stranger said, is the same.

**Postscript (1947)**

Years later — if years are not merely another fiction of memory — I believed I rediscovered that manuscript in a library whose identity I prefer to withhold, not from discretion but from incredulity. The volume, bound in a gray cloth I did not recall, appeared in a recent catalogue under an erroneous classification: *Treatises on Optics*.

I did not at once recognize the text. It was a sentence, nearly identical to one I had forgotten, that restored the suspicion:

“Light, that instrument of appearance, is also an organ of memory.”

The librarian — whose face struck me as vaguely familiar — informed me, with the indifference characteristic of those who guard eternities, that the manuscript had been recovered from the remains of an observatory burned in Quito. No one could determine the date of the disaster. Some spoke of an accident; others, of a less trivial cause.

Among the salvaged papers — he added — were incomprehensible diagrams, executed with a meticulousness that evoked both stellar maps and labyrinths. Scholars disagreed in their interpretations: some discerned formulas; others, mere symmetries.

A German physicist, whose name I have lost, suggested that those figures described not bodies nor trajectories, but relations. Not matter, but structure.

Not reality, but possibility.

I read the manuscript again.

Nothing had changed.

Or perhaps everything.

I add, however, a detail which I judge less incidental than it may appear. A chance — which these pages now compel me to call destiny — allowed me to consult the archives of the ancient Society of Jesus. There, in a register dated 1762, is recorded the transient blindness of a novice who, after contemplating the nocturnal firmament above the Andes, declared that he had seen not stars, but “a system of memories that observe us.”

The novice’s name, curiously enough, was Ricardo.

I do not venture to decide whether this testimony confirms the manuscript’s doctrine or whether it constitutes merely another variation of that vast artifice by which consciousness, in order to persist in the illusion of the world, fragments itself into observatories, fires, libraries, and men.

I understood then — if understanding is not yet another indulgent metaphor — that fires, losses, rediscoveries, do not contradict the persistence of certain ideas. They destroy them in one place only to restore them in another.

Every disappearance is a form of recurrence.

Every recurrence, a form of memory.

And I suspected, with a certainty I dare not call conviction, that the manuscript had not traveled from the ruins of an observatory, nor from some remote afternoon, but from that vaster region where texts, readers, light, and memory share a single substance.

That which, under innumerable names, we continue to call consciousness.
