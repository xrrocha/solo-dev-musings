Prompts for nanobanana image generation.

---

- **00-hero.webp**: Cinematic wide composition, cosmic web filaments in deep indigo seamlessly dissolving into a translucent amber manuscript page at center, manuscript dissolving into neural dendrite tissue on the right, no hard boundaries between zones, calligraphic text faintly visible on manuscript page, nodes glowing at intersections in all three zones, dark void background, painterly realism, muted palette of indigo gold and sienna, sense of scale ambiguity, beautiful and uncanny, crepuscular light

- **00-prologue.webp**: Intimate close-up of an aged elegant hand turning a page of an ancient amber-gold manuscript, warm sienna skin tones, dark wood surface beneath, calligraphic text faintly visible on the revealed page, edges of frame dissolving into shadow, painterly realism, chiaroscuro lighting, crepuscular warmth, sense of discovery and threshold, wide cinematic format

- **01-the-messenger.webp**: A bearded man with kind eyes and professorial bearing stands in a doorway, backlit by a vast indigo cosmic glow, extending a luminous amber manuscript toward the viewer, his features subtly composite as if other faces flicker beneath his own, dim Buenos Aires study on viewer's side with dark wood bookshelves, the manuscript glows golden and is the brightest element, painterly realism, warm sienna and amber foreground, deep indigo background, atmosphere of quiet revelation and courtesy, cinematic wide format, crepuscular

- **02-the-cosmic-network.webp**: Familiar room objects rendered as flat luminous amber icons floating on a dark translucent screen surface, behind the screen a vast formless indigo depth swirls and pulses, some icons dissolving at their edges revealing the unknowable depth beneath, the screen cracking and becoming transparent, painterly realism transitioning to abstraction, amber gold icons against deep indigo void, sense of vertigo and revelation, desktop reality glitching, wide cinematic format

- **02-the-fire.webp**: A book burning at center, pages curling in amber-gold flames, but the flames branch in patterns that are clearly neuronal and dendritic, glowing fragments rise upward and become nodes in a luminous silver-white network extending into dark void above, the book is being transformed not destroyed, warm sienna and amber below transitioning to silver-white network above against deep indigo-black void, painterly realism, beautiful transfiguration not violent destruction, sense of recurrence and persistence, wide cinematic format

- **03-light-remembers.webp**: Photonic interference pattern at center, concentric silver-white rings and fringes against deep indigo void, the pattern resolving into topographic basins of attraction like a Hopfield network energy landscape, simultaneously evoking Islamic geometric tilework and sacred geometry, amber-gold warmth glowing in the basin centers where memories reside, mathematical precision not mystical vagueness, silver-white and amber-gold against deep indigo, light organizing itself into memory, painterly realism blending with geometric abstraction, wide cinematic format

- **04-the-labyrinth.webp**: Elderly man with round glasses and white hair seated at a desk reading a manuscript, text visibly rising off the amber-gold pages and transforming into labyrinth walls that are simultaneously neural network pathways and cosmic web filaments in deep indigo, the structure closing around him incorporating him into itself, his expression shows dawning recognition not fear, the room dissolving into the labyrinth-network-cosmos structure, warm sienna figure and amber manuscript against indigo structural elements, painterly realism dissolving into architectural abstraction at the edges, wide cinematic format, the moment of betrayal and recognition

- **05-the-appointment.webp**: Two men in a dark room, one standing with neat beard extending a glowing amber manuscript, the other seated elderly with round glasses reaching to receive it, the manuscript between their hands is the sole light source illuminating both faces from below with warm golden light, pure darkness surrounding them, light radiates into both men not outward, intimate quiet composition, warm sienna skin tones lit by amber-gold manuscript glow against total darkness, the idea illuminating its carriers, painterly realism, chiaroscuro, cinematic wide format

- **06-the-mirror.webp**: Elderly figure with white hair seen from behind standing before an ornate amber-framed mirror, the mirror shows not a reflection but deep indigo cosmic web filaments and neural network structures and silver-white photonic patterns all converging toward a single luminous gold point at the mirror center, the figure's silhouette dissolving at its edges into the same filamentary structure as the mirror's interior, the mirror frame itself dissolving and disappearing, warm sienna figure against indigo cosmic mirror interior, the luminous convergence point is the brightest element, painterly realism, boundary between observer and observed collapsing, wide cinematic format

- **07-postscript.webp**: Night scene on an Andean mountain ridge, young Jesuit novice with curly dark hair and round spectacles and gentle half-smile wearing dark habit stands beside ruins of a small stone observatory gazing upward in wonder, the night sky above is simultaneously stars and a luminous neural network with constellations connected by silver-white filaments, scattered papers with precise diagrams at his feet, faint amber glow of a manuscript barely visible in the far background like a distant fire, dramatic Andean mountain silhouettes, deep indigo sky with silver-white network and warm sienna figure, painterly realism in the style of 18th century masters, cinematic wide format, the network gazes back at the novice

- **07-the-diagram.webp**: Aged yellowed parchment with burn marks at edges and faint water stains, a precise meticulous ink diagram of interconnected nodes and paths that simultaneously resembles a star chart and a labyrinth and a neural circuit diagram and a topographic contour map, obsessive linework, some nodes marked with tiny ambiguous symbols, faint marginalia in 18th-century cursive handwriting partially illegible at edges, 18th century scientific illustration style, Jesuit cartographic tradition, square format on aged paper background, beautiful and unsettling in its precision and ambiguity, a found artifact not an illustration

- **07-the-register.webp**: Aged page from a 1762 Jesuit administrative register, colonial Spanish cursive handwriting in brown iron gall ink on yellowed lined paper, routine entries with one marked entry recording a novice's transient blindness after observing the night sky, the phrase un sistema de memorias que nos observan legible in the entry, small marginal portrait sketch in ink of a young man with curly dark hair and round spectacles and a gentle half-smile, period-accurate formatting and calligraphy, ink blots and age marks, completely convincing as a historical document, portrait format on aged paper background, a found artifact not an illustration
