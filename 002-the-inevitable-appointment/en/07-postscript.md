# Postscript (1947)

Years later - if years are not yet another fiction of memory - I believed I had rediscovered that manuscript in a library whose identity I prefer to withhold, not from discretion but from incredulity. The volume, bound in a gray cloth I did not recall, appeared in a recent catalogue under an erroneous classification: *Treatises on Optics*.

I did not recognize the text at once. It was a sentence, nearly identical to one I had forgotten, that restored the suspicion:

"Light, that instrument of appearance, is also an organ of memory."

The librarian - whose face struck me as vaguely familiar - informed me, with the indifference of those who guard eternities, that the manuscript had come from the remains of an observatory burned in Quito. No one could fix the date of the disaster. Some spoke of an accident; others, of a less trivial cause.

Among the salvaged papers, he added, were incomprehensible diagrams, drawn with a meticulousness that evoked both stellar charts and labyrinths. The scholars who examined them disagreed in their readings: some saw formulas; others, mere symmetries.

A German physicist, whose name I have lost, suggested that those figures described not bodies or trajectories but relations. Not matter, but structure.

Not reality, but possibility.

I read the manuscript again.

Nothing had changed.

Or perhaps everything.

I add, however, a detail I judge less incidental than it appears. A chance - which these pages now compel me to call destiny - allowed me to consult the archives of the former Society of Jesus in San Francisco de Quito. There, in a register dated 1762, is recorded the transient blindness of a novice who, after contemplating the night sky above the Andes, declared that he had seen not stars but "a system of memories observing us."

The novice's name, curiously, was Francis.

A later entry by the rector, dated three days after, records that the young man was admonished for confusing astronomical observation with philosophical delirium, and forbidden to register visions that could not be reconciled with established doctrine. The rector added, with a severity that perhaps concealed disquiet, that the suggestion that the Creator had encoded the *liber mundi* with subtle clues inviting decipherment was a presumption incompatible with the humility required by the Rule. [6]

I do not venture to decide whether this testimony confirms the manuscript's doctrine or constitutes merely another variation of that vast artifice by which consciousness, in order to persist in the illusion of the world, fragments itself into observatories, fires, libraries, and men.

I understood then - if to understand is not yet another indulgent metaphor - that fires, losses, rediscoveries do not contradict the persistence of certain ideas. They destroy them in one place to restore them in another.

Every disappearance is a form of recurrence.

Every recurrence, a form of memory.

And I suspected, with a certainty I dare not call conviction, that the manuscript had traveled not from the ruins of an observatory, nor from some remote afternoon, but from that vaster region where texts, readers, light, and memory share a single substance.

That which, under innumerable names, we go on calling consciousness.

[6] Archivo de la Provincia Quitensis S.I., Registro de Observaciones y Amonestaciones, vol. XIV, f. 203r. The passage was noted by Fr. Juan De Velasco in a private communication I have been unable to verify. It will be observed that the rector's prohibition did not prevent the survival of the testimony, which, as the reader will note, does not contradict but rather confirms the manuscript's doctrine.
