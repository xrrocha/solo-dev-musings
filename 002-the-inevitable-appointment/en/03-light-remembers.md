# III. Light Remembers

In later pages, the manuscript alluded to certain experiments - whose authenticity it did not deign to justify - that seemed to suggest that light, that instrument of appearance, is also an organ of memory. It referred not to trivial mechanisms but to a more disquieting property: that luminous corpuscles, propagating through certain configurations, spontaneously reproduce patterns they have already traversed, as though light remembered. [4] This was not, however, an unlimited memory: the manuscript observed that as the stored figures multiplied, the luminous system degenerated into a state of disorder that the author compared, with a metaphor perhaps involuntary, to forgetting.

It spoke not of mechanisms or particles but of correspondences. The ancient metaphor of illumination - so dear to mystics and theologians - acquired in those pages a literalness the author saw no need to defend.

The brain, it was suggested, would not be foreign to this condition. What we call thought might be nothing more than a modulation of clarity.

The speculation advanced toward artifices capable of imitating such recurrences. These were not machines that stored memories but structures in which memories, so to speak, repeated themselves.

At the macroscopic scale, the universe evoked a network.

At the microscopic, the network evoked consciousness.

The author observed - almost *en passant* - that this symmetry, as disquieting as it was inevitable, had been anticipated by doctrines far older than physics. He cited, without emphasis, the axiom attributed to Hermes Trismegistus: *as above, so below*. [5]

Between these two mirrors, consciousness figured not as epiphenomenon but as the sole consistent inhabitant.

[4] A similar observation is attributed to the German optician Georg Hupfeld (*Studien über das Gedächtnis des Lichtes*, Göttingen, 1847), who claimed to have demonstrated that light, in traversing certain crystalline configurations, spontaneously reproduces figures it has previously traversed, as though it retained a memory of its paths. Hupfeld added that this memory was not unlimited: as the imposed figures multiplied, the system degenerated into a disorder he termed, with involuntary eloquence, *Glaserstarrung* - vitreous rigidity.
