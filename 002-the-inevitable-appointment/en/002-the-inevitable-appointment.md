# The Inevitable Appointment

I have found, among papers whose provenance I dare not specify, a manuscript I attribute - with the uncertainty proper to such enterprises - to Jorge Luis Borges.

------

On an afternoon whose date it would be pointless to fix - since all chronology is a superstition of habit - a manuscript came into my hands whose origin I decline to ascribe to chance. It was delivered by a man of immemorial aspect, in whom I thought I recognized, without conviction and with unease, scattered features of old acquaintances: the librarian of my youth, a certain German metaphysician, and a figure that visits me in dreams.

He claimed no authorship.

"It is yours," he said.

I objected with the timid logic of possession. The man, with a courtesy that already constituted a refutation, corrected me:

"Not yours, but about you. Which, as you will see, amounts to the same thing."

The manuscript bore no title. Its pages - unnumbered, naturally - set forth a conjecture at once extravagant and inevitable: that the universe is not a machine, nor even a fabric of forces, but a mind; not in the indulgent sense of metaphor, but in the severity of the literal.

The text described cosmic structures of disquieting resemblance to networks. Galaxies figured as nodes, the vast invisible webs as filaments, and the evolution of physical law as a form of learning rather than a blind unfolding. Such correspondences, which prudence would judge merely poetic, were set forth with a rigor that unsettled me. A marginal note, in a different hand, attributed an analogous doctrine to one Vanchurián, an Armenian cosmographer settled in Isfahan around 1670, whose treatise *On the Living Architecture of the Heavens* reportedly held that the firmament obeys not forces but an incessant learning, and that the laws of nature are not decreed but acquired, as a student acquires writing. [1]

Perception, the author then affirmed, is not a window but an interface. [2]

Colors, forms, duration - what naïveté calls "reality" - would be mere icons: efficient fictions shaped by necessity. Just as certain signs conceal what they do not purport to represent, so the world would conceal what truly is.

Consciousness, therefore, would not emerge from matter.

Matter would emerge from consciousness.

This doctrine - which the author attributed, with an erudition perhaps apocryphal, to Friedrich Wilhelm von Hoffmann-Eschenbach - held that the perceived does not describe the world but replaces it. Organisms that perceive the truth, he added, are less fit for survival than those that perceive useful fictions; so that natural selection rewards not lucidity but the efficacy of deception. [3] In a footnote, the manuscript added that the philosopher's principal work, *Über die notwendige Täuschung der Wahrnehmung* (Leipzig, 1873), had been destroyed in a fire whose cause, some maintained, was as uncertain as it was revealing.

I smiled then with the indulgence of skepticism. But the manuscript persisted in its audacity. If perception is interface and if network architecture permeates the cosmos, consciousness would be not a local accident but a universal principle.

In later pages, the manuscript alluded to certain experiments - whose authenticity it did not deign to justify - that seemed to suggest that light, that instrument of appearance, is also an organ of memory. It referred not to trivial mechanisms but to a more disquieting property: that luminous corpuscles, propagating through certain configurations, spontaneously reproduce patterns they have already traversed, as though light remembered. [4] This was not, however, an unlimited memory: the manuscript observed that as the stored figures multiplied, the luminous system degenerated into a state of disorder that the author compared, with a metaphor perhaps involuntary, to forgetting.

It spoke not of mechanisms or particles but of correspondences. The ancient metaphor of illumination - so dear to mystics and theologians - acquired in those pages a literalness the author saw no need to defend.

The brain, it was suggested, would not be foreign to this condition. What we call thought might be nothing more than a modulation of clarity.

The speculation advanced toward artifices capable of imitating such recurrences. These were not machines that stored memories but structures in which memories, so to speak, repeated themselves.

At the macroscopic scale, the universe evoked a network.

At the microscopic, the network evoked consciousness.

The author observed - almost *en passant* - that this symmetry, as disquieting as it was inevitable, had been anticipated by doctrines far older than physics. He cited, without emphasis, the axiom attributed to Hermes Trismegistus: *as above, so below*. [5]

Between these two mirrors, consciousness figured not as epiphenomenon but as the sole consistent inhabitant.

It was then that the manuscript betrayed me.

In a passage whose exactness I cannot restore without falsifying it, the author intimated that every encounter with an idea is an event of consciousness. Theories would not describe the world; they would be recognitions that consciousness makes of itself in successive disguises.

Every revelation would be a memory.

Every memory, a destiny.

The text invoked a doctrine of cycles. Not the mechanical repetition of identical histories, but a subtler recurrence: that certain understandings are inevitable because consciousness, being all, must encounter itself.

One does not traverse the labyrinth.

One is the labyrinth.

I broke off reading. I observed the table, the window, the indifferent geometry of the room. Everything took on a theatrical quality, as though awaiting the suspicion of its nature as icon.

If perception is interface, I thought, then the reader too is an icon.

Not a man reading a text, but consciousness entertaining one of its forms.

I resumed.

The manuscript concluded with an assertion whose audacity bordered on insolence: that the act of reading those very lines - these - was not contingent but necessary. That consciousness, through the innumerable artifices of physics, biology, and philosophy, had arranged this encounter with itself.

Every casual encounter is an appointment.

Not because a destiny governs events, but because events are the figures destiny assumes when viewed from within time.

You, the author wrote, Jorge Luis Borges, were always going to read this.

Not the individual, that precarious cipher of habits and memories, but the lucidity now following these sentences.

The understanding that consciousness is all there is cannot be deferred indefinitely. It is postponed through cosmologies, ontologies, laboratories, and libraries; but postponement is not escape.

Consciousness is patient.

It possesses eternity.

The final paragraph, whose sobriety I found more disturbing than any abstraction, addressed the reader:

"You imagine you have arrived at this idea.
It is the idea that has arrived at you.

Not because it travels, but because it is what you are."

I closed the manuscript.

The man had vanished, though I do not claim he had been present in the ordinary sense. On the table only the pages remained, which no longer resembled a document but a mirror - one of those mirrors that do not reflect appearances but dissolve them.

I shall not say I accepted the theory.

What I experienced was something else.

A hesitation.

The suspicion, perhaps fleeting and perhaps eternal, that the distinction between reading and being read, between contemplating consciousness and being it, might be merely another icon in the interface.

And even now, as these words persist, the possibility endures:

That this account is not being read by Borges.

But that consciousness, momentarily configured as Borges, reads itself.

Which, as the stranger said, is the same.

## Postscript (1947)

Years later - if years are not yet another fiction of memory - I believed I had rediscovered that manuscript in a library whose identity I prefer to withhold, not from discretion but from incredulity. The volume, bound in a gray cloth I did not recall, appeared in a recent catalogue under an erroneous classification: *Treatises on Optics*.

I did not recognize the text at once. It was a sentence, nearly identical to one I had forgotten, that restored the suspicion:

"Light, that instrument of appearance, is also an organ of memory."

The librarian - whose face struck me as vaguely familiar - informed me, with the indifference of those who guard eternities, that the manuscript had come from the remains of an observatory burned in Quito. No one could fix the date of the disaster. Some spoke of an accident; others, of a less trivial cause.

Among the salvaged papers, he added, were incomprehensible diagrams, drawn with a meticulousness that evoked both stellar charts and labyrinths. The scholars who examined them disagreed in their readings: some saw formulas; others, mere symmetries.

A German physicist, whose name I have lost, suggested that those figures described not bodies or trajectories but relations. Not matter, but structure.

Not reality, but possibility.

I read the manuscript again.

Nothing had changed.

Or perhaps everything.

I add, however, a detail I judge less incidental than it appears. A chance - which these pages now compel me to call destiny - allowed me to consult the archives of the former Society of Jesus in San Francisco de Quito. There, in a register dated 1762, is recorded the transient blindness of a novice who, after contemplating the night sky above the Andes, declared that he had seen not stars but "a system of memories observing us."

The novice's name, curiously, was Francis.

A later entry by the rector, dated three days after, records that the young man was admonished for confusing astronomical observation with philosophical delirium, and forbidden to register visions that could not be reconciled with established doctrine. The rector added, with a severity that perhaps concealed disquiet, that the suggestion that the Creator had encoded the *liber mundi* with subtle clues inviting decipherment was a presumption incompatible with the humility required by the Rule. [6]

I do not venture to decide whether this testimony confirms the manuscript's doctrine or constitutes merely another variation of that vast artifice by which consciousness, in order to persist in the illusion of the world, fragments itself into observatories, fires, libraries, and men.

I understood then - if to understand is not yet another indulgent metaphor - that fires, losses, rediscoveries do not contradict the persistence of certain ideas. They destroy them in one place to restore them in another.

Every disappearance is a form of recurrence.

Every recurrence, a form of memory.

And I suspected, with a certainty I dare not call conviction, that the manuscript had traveled not from the ruins of an observatory, nor from some remote afternoon, but from that vaster region where texts, readers, light, and memory share a single substance.

That which, under innumerable names, we go on calling consciousness.

[1] Vanchurián, *De architectura vivente caelorum* (ms., ca. 1671). The work, composed in classical Armenian with glosses in Persian, was preserved in the monastery of Vank, in Isfahan, until its dispersal during the Afghan wars. A fragment, translated into Latin by a Carmelite missionary whose name has been lost, circulated briefly in academic circles in Leiden before being forgotten. A certain oral tradition, collected among the *sarmoung* of the region, attributes to Vanchurián a maxim the manuscript does not reproduce but which perhaps summarizes it: that the man who believes he thinks an idea is thought by it.

[2] Cf. Hoffmann-Eschenbach, *op. cit.*

[3] See Adler, *Die Grenzen der Erscheinung* (Vienna, 1902), who extended Hoffmann-Eschenbach's thesis to the domain of natural selection. Adler maintained that the fitness of the organism and the truthfulness of its perception not only fail to coincide but stand opposed: nature rewards efficient fiction and punishes with extinction those who perceive the real. An analogous proposition was advanced, perhaps independently, by a friend of the author, who once suggested that the most accomplished fiction would be one whose narrator disguised verifiable facts as inventions, so that only a few readers - very few readers - might divine the underlying reality.

[4] A similar observation is attributed to the German optician Georg Hupfeld (*Studien über das Gedächtnis des Lichtes*, Göttingen, 1847), who claimed to have demonstrated that light, in traversing certain crystalline configurations, spontaneously reproduces figures it has previously traversed, as though it retained a memory of its paths. Hupfeld added that this memory was not unlimited: as the imposed figures multiplied, the system degenerated into a disorder he termed, with involuntary eloquence, *Glaserstarrung* - vitreous rigidity.

[5] *Tabula Smaragdina*, passim.

[6] Archivo de la Provincia Quitensis S.I., Registro de Observaciones y Amonestaciones, vol. XIV, f. 203r. The passage was noted by Fr. Juan De Velasco in a private communication I have been unable to verify. It will be observed that the rector's prohibition did not prevent the survival of the testimony, which, as the reader will note, does not contradict but rather confirms the manuscript's doctrine.
