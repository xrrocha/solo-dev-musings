# I. The Messenger

On an afternoon whose date it would be pointless to fix - since all chronology is a superstition of habit - a manuscript came into my hands whose origin I decline to ascribe to chance. It was delivered by a man of immemorial aspect, in whom I thought I recognized, without conviction and with unease, scattered features of old acquaintances: the librarian of my youth, a certain German metaphysician, and a figure that visits me in dreams.

He claimed no authorship.

"It is yours," he said.

I objected with the timid logic of possession. The man, with a courtesy that already constituted a refutation, corrected me:

"Not yours, but about you. Which, as you will see, amounts to the same thing."
