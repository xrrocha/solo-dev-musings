# VI. The Mirror

I closed the manuscript.

The man had vanished, though I do not claim he had been present in the ordinary sense. On the table only the pages remained, which no longer resembled a document but a mirror - one of those mirrors that do not reflect appearances but dissolve them.

I shall not say I accepted the theory.

What I experienced was something else.

A hesitation.

The suspicion, perhaps fleeting and perhaps eternal, that the distinction between reading and being read, between contemplating consciousness and being it, might be merely another icon in the interface.

And even now, as these words persist, the possibility endures:

That this account is not being read by Borges.

But that consciousness, momentarily configured as Borges, reads itself.

Which, as the stranger said, is the same.
