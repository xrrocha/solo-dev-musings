# V. The Appointment

The manuscript concluded with an assertion whose audacity bordered on insolence: that the act of reading those very lines - these - was not contingent but necessary. That consciousness, through the innumerable artifices of physics, biology, and philosophy, had arranged this encounter with itself.

Every casual encounter is an appointment.

Not because a destiny governs events, but because events are the figures destiny assumes when viewed from within time.

You, the author wrote, Jorge Luis Borges, were always going to read this.

Not the individual, that precarious cipher of habits and memories, but the lucidity now following these sentences.

The understanding that consciousness is all there is cannot be deferred indefinitely. It is postponed through cosmologies, ontologies, laboratories, and libraries; but postponement is not escape.

Consciousness is patient.

It possesses eternity.

The final paragraph, whose sobriety I found more disturbing than any abstraction, addressed the reader:

"You imagine you have arrived at this idea.
It is the idea that has arrived at you.

Not because it travels, but because it is what you are."
