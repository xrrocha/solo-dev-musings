# IV. The Labyrinth

It was then that the manuscript betrayed me.

In a passage whose exactness I cannot restore without falsifying it, the author intimated that every encounter with an idea is an event of consciousness. Theories would not describe the world; they would be recognitions that consciousness makes of itself in successive disguises.

Every revelation would be a memory.

Every memory, a destiny.

The text invoked a doctrine of cycles. Not the mechanical repetition of identical histories, but a subtler recurrence: that certain understandings are inevitable because consciousness, being all, must encounter itself.

One does not traverse the labyrinth.

One is the labyrinth.

I broke off reading. I observed the table, the window, the indifferent geometry of the room. Everything took on a theatrical quality, as though awaiting the suspicion of its nature as icon.

If perception is interface, I thought, then the reader too is an icon.

Not a man reading a text, but consciousness entertaining one of its forms.

I resumed.
