# II. The Cosmic Network

The manuscript bore no title. Its pages - unnumbered, naturally - set forth a conjecture at once extravagant and inevitable: that the universe is not a machine, nor even a fabric of forces, but a mind; not in the indulgent sense of metaphor, but in the severity of the literal.

The text described cosmic structures of disquieting resemblance to networks. Galaxies figured as nodes, the vast invisible webs as filaments, and the evolution of physical law as a form of learning rather than a blind unfolding. Such correspondences, which prudence would judge merely poetic, were set forth with a rigor that unsettled me. A marginal note, in a different hand, attributed an analogous doctrine to one Vanchurián, an Armenian cosmographer settled in Isfahan around 1670, whose treatise *On the Living Architecture of the Heavens* reportedly held that the firmament obeys not forces but an incessant learning, and that the laws of nature are not decreed but acquired, as a student acquires writing. [1]

Perception, the author then affirmed, is not a window but an interface. [2]

Colors, forms, duration - what naïveté calls "reality" - would be mere icons: efficient fictions shaped by necessity. Just as certain signs conceal what they do not purport to represent, so the world would conceal what truly is.

Consciousness, therefore, would not emerge from matter.

Matter would emerge from consciousness.

This doctrine - which the author attributed, with an erudition perhaps apocryphal, to Friedrich Wilhelm von Hoffmann-Eschenbach - held that the perceived does not describe the world but replaces it. Organisms that perceive the truth, he added, are less fit for survival than those that perceive useful fictions; so that natural selection rewards not lucidity but the efficacy of deception. [3] In a footnote, the manuscript added that the philosopher's principal work, *Über die notwendige Täuschung der Wahrnehmung* (Leipzig, 1873), had been destroyed in a fire whose cause, some maintained, was as uncertain as it was revealing.

I smiled then with the indulgence of skepticism. But the manuscript persisted in its audacity. If perception is interface and if network architecture permeates the cosmos, consciousness would be not a local accident but a universal principle.

[1] Vanchurián, *De architectura vivente caelorum* (ms., ca. 1671). The work, composed in classical Armenian with glosses in Persian, was preserved in the monastery of Vank, in Isfahan, until its dispersal during the Afghan wars. A fragment, translated into Latin by a Carmelite missionary whose name has been lost, circulated briefly in academic circles in Leiden before being forgotten. A certain oral tradition, collected among the *sarmoung* of the region, attributes to Vanchurián a maxim the manuscript does not reproduce but which perhaps summarizes it: that the man who believes he thinks an idea is thought by it.

[2] Cf. Hoffmann-Eschenbach, *op. cit.*

[3] See Adler, *Die Grenzen der Erscheinung* (Vienna, 1902), who extended Hoffmann-Eschenbach's thesis to the domain of natural selection. Adler maintained that the fitness of the organism and the truthfulness of its perception not only fail to coincide but stand opposed: nature rewards efficient fiction and punishes with extinction those who perceive the real. An analogous proposition was advanced, perhaps independently, by a friend of the author, who once suggested that the most accomplished fiction would be one whose narrator disguised verifiable facts as inventions, so that only a few readers - very few readers - might divine the underlying reality.
